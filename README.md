Data-Driven Statistical Models for Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in Odisha

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity in the state of Odisha, India, using statistical and data-driven modeling approaches. 
It integrates climate and crop data to build predictive models and visualize trends to assist policymakers, researchers, and farmers.

Objectives

- To explore the relationship between climate variables and agricultural yield in Odisha.
- To develop data-driven statistical models for impact assessment.
- To visualize climate trends and agricultural changes over time.
- To identify key climate indicators influencing crop productivity.

 Methodology

- Data Collection: Historical climate data (temperature, rainfall, etc.) and agricultural yield data.
- Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing data.
- Statistical Analysis: Correlation, regression, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Modeling: Time series models, linear regression, and other statistical techniques.
- Visualization: Trend analysis, seasonal patterns, heatmaps, and plots using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
